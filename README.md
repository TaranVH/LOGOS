# Logos

A collection of mostly tech-related logos that I (Taran Van Hemert) have collected over the last few years of video production. Some of them were remarkably difficult to find in a high enough quality.
.SVGs are cool and all, but Premiere Pro cannot handle them. So these are almost entirely .pngs with transparent backgrounds.

## Usage

All logos belong to their respective brands. Please research your brand's guidelines on using its logo. (If you care about that sort of thing.)

## Categories

> Note: If a logo corresponds both to the product and the name of the company that owns it, the logo belongs in either the Programs and Games category or Products category (notable examples are Netflix and Hulu)
