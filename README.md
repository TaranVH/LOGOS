# Logos

A collection of mostly tech-related logos that I (Taran Van Hemert) have collected over the last few years of video production. Some of them were remarkably difficult to find in a high enough quality.
.SVGs are cool and all, but Premiere Pro cannot handle them. So these are almost entirely .pngs with transparent backgrounds.

## Usage

All logos belong to their respective brands. Please research your brand's guidelines on using its logo. (If you care about that sort of thing.)
